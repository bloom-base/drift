# PR #1 Review Verification

**Date**: 2024-02-02  
**Reviewer**: @dannovikov  
**PR**: Update README to reflect evolution simulation project (#1)  
**Status**: ✅ **MERGED & VERIFIED**

## Review Checklist - All Items Approved

- ✅ Removed incorrect authentication library description
- ✅ Added comprehensive overview of evolution simulation capabilities
- ✅ Core features clearly listed (allele frequency tracking, population dynamics, genetic drift modeling, selection pressure simulation)
- ✅ Target audience appropriately identified (evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, researchers)
- ✅ Professional formatting and clear writing

## Current README Status

The README.md in the main branch (commit bf4a717) now accurately reflects:

### Project Description
- Positioned as a "powerful simulation platform for researchers to model genetic drift, natural selection, and population dynamics"
- Clear evolutionary focus with no authentication library references

### Core Features
- Allele Frequency Tracking: Monitor how allele frequencies change over generations
- Population Dynamics: Simulate population size effects on genetic variation
- Genetic Drift Modeling: Understand random sampling effects in finite populations
- Selection Pressure Simulation: Model natural selection and adaptive evolution

### Target Audience
- Evolutionary biologists
- Population geneticists
- Researchers studying evolutionary processes

### Documentation Structure
- Clean and professional formatting
- Links to CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Clear "Getting Involved" section for contributions

## Conclusion

PR #1 has been successfully merged with all reviewer feedback addressed. The README provides an accurate, comprehensive, and professional description of drift as an evolution simulation platform, serving as a solid foundation for the project.
