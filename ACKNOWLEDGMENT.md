## PR #1 - README Update for Evolution Simulation Project

**Reviewer:** dannovikov  
**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Status:** ✅ Approved and Merged

### Review Feedback
The reviewer provided comprehensive approval with the following validations:
- ✅ Removed incorrect authentication library description
- ✅ Added comprehensive overview of evolution simulation capabilities
- ✅ Core features clearly listed (allele frequency tracking, population dynamics, genetic drift modeling, selection pressure simulation)
- ✅ Target audience appropriately identified (evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, researchers)
- ✅ Professional formatting and clear writing

### Outcome
