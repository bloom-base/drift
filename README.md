# drift

A powerful simulation platform for researchers to model genetic drift, natural selection, and population dynamics.

## Overview

**drift** enables researchers to visualize and analyze evolutionary processes across generations. Model allele frequencies, test evolutionary hypotheses, and develop predictive models for genetic outcomes across diverse organisms.

## Core Features

- **Allele Frequency Tracking**: Monitor how allele frequencies change over generations
- **Population Dynamics**: Simulate population size effects on genetic variation
- **Genetic Drift Modeling**: Understand random sampling effects in finite populations
- **Selection Pressure Simulation**: Model natural selection and adaptive evolution

## Purpose

Designed for evolutionary biologists, population geneticists, and researchers studying evolutionary processes, drift provides the tools to explore how genetic variation changes over time under different evolutionary forces.
