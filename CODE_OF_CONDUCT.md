# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The drift project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. We value integrity, transparency, and proper process in all our work, including code review and verification.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, experiences, and backgrounds
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Review and Verification Process

A core commitment of the drift project is maintaining an unbiased and credible review process:

- **Independent Review**: Code changes must be reviewed by contributors independent of the code author
- **No Self-Approval**: Authors cannot approve their own pull requests
- **GitHub Native Systems**: We use GitHub's built-in review mechanisms for all verifications and approvals
- **Proper Documentation**: Process records are maintained through GitHub's PR system, not in committed files
- **Audit Trail**: All reviews, approvals, and discussions are preserved through GitHub's native features

## Repository Hygiene

We maintain a clean repository history containing only project artifacts:

- **Included**: Code, technical documentation, contribution guidelines, release notes
- **Not Included**: Procedural review records, self-verification files, administrative logs

This separation ensures:
- Clear distinction between project artifacts and process documentation
- Reliable repository history focused on code and technical content
- Proper use of GitHub's built-in verification mechanisms
- Credible and unbiased verification process

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
